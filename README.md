## 🏗 Project Instructions

### **Step 1: Make Some Slip**
1. Take a small piece of air-dry clay and place it in a bowl or cup.
2. Add some water (**water-clay ratio = 1:3**) and mix it with a brush or a stick.
3. Set it aside for later use. **This slip will act as glue** to attach clay pieces together more securely.

3. Roll it out into a flat piece (**4-6 inches in diameter, 1/4-inch thick**) using a rolling pin.
4. Use a **small bowl or cookie cutter** to cut out a circle.
5. Smooth the edges with your fingers using a little slip and water.
