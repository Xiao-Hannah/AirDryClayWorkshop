## 🏗 Project Instructions

### **Step 1: Make Some Slip**
1. Take a small piece of air-dry clay and place it in a bowl or cup.
2. Add some water (**water-clay ratio = 1:3**) and mix it with a brush or a stick.
3. Set it aside for later use. **This slip will act as glue** to attach clay pieces together more securely.

### **Step 2: Slabbing & Coiling (Creating the Plate Base)**
#### **Slab Method:**
1. Take a chunk of air-dry clay and knead it to soften.
2. **Even slab trick:** Use two stacked wooden pieces on both sides of the air-dry clay.
3. Roll it out into a flat piece (**4-6 inches in diameter, 1/4-inch thick**) using a rolling pin.
4. Use a **small bowl or cookie cutter** to cut out a circle.
5. Smooth the edges with your fingers using a little slip and water.

### **Step 3: Score & Slip**
1. Score both the **coil surface and the outer rim of the plate** using hatch marks.
2. Apply **slip** to the hatched areas as glue.
3. Smooth the surface with slip to create a **strong bond**.

### **Step 4: Shape the Cactus Arms**
1. Roll a small piece of clay into a **thick cylinder (2-3 inches tall)** for the cactus trunk.
2. Smooth the surface with **slip** if necessary.
3. Cut the bottom part of the cactus to make a **flat base**, then set it aside to dry.
4. Roll out **two smaller, thinner cylinders** and bend them to mimic cactus arms.
5. Cut the arms to size and attach them using **score and slip** (see Step 3).
6. Let the cactus dry for a while.

2. Gently press the cactus onto the center of the plate.
3. Use **slip** to secure the connection.
4. Blend and smooth the seams where the pieces join.
5. Let it sit for a few minutes to ensure stability.

### **Step 6: Let It Dry**
1. Leave the clay piece in a **dry, well-ventilated area** for **24-48 hours**.
2. Avoid **direct sunlight or heat sources** to prevent cracks.
3. When the clay turns **white**, it's ready for the next step.

2. Paint the **cactus green** with acrylic paint. Add realistic textures or patterns.
3. Paint the **plate brown, white, or any color** you prefer.
