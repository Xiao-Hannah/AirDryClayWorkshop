## üèó Project Instructions

### **Step 1: Make Some Slip**
1. Take a small piece of air-dry clay and place it in a bowl or cup.
2. Add some water (**water-clay ratio = 1:3**) and mix it with a brush or a stick.
3. Set it aside for later use. This slip will act as glue to attach clay pieces together more securely.

### **Step 2: Slabbing & Coiling (Creating the Plate Base)**
#### **Slab Method:**
1. Take a chunk of air-dry clay and knead it to soften.
2. **Even slab trick:** Use two stacked wooden pieces on both sides of the air-dry clay.
3. Roll it out into a flat piece (**4-6 inches in diameter, 1/4-inch thick**) using a rolling pin.
4. Use a small bowl or cookie cutter to cut out a circle.
5. Smooth the edges with your fingers using a little slip and water.

#### **Coil Method:**
1. Take a small piece of clay.
2. Roll it out evenly by moving your hands **inwards and outwards**.

### **Step 3: Score & Slip**
1. Score both the coil surface and the outer rim of the plate using hatch marks.
2. Apply slip to the hatched areas as glue.
3. Smooth the surface with slip to create a strong bond.

### **Step 4: Shape the Cactus Arms**
1. Roll a small piece of clay into a **thick cylinder (2-3 inches tall)** for the cactus trunk.
2. Roll out **two smaller, thinner cylinders** and bend them to mimic cactus arms.
3. Smooth the surface with slip if necessary.

4. Blend and smooth the seams where the pieces join.
5. Let it sit for a few minutes to ensure stability.

### **Step 6: Let It Dry**
1. Leave the clay piece in a **dry, well-ventilated area** for **24-48 hours**.
2. Avoid **direct sunlight or heat sources** to prevent cracks.
3. When the clay turns **white**, it's ready for the next step.

---

### **Step 7: Sand & Paint**
1. *(Optional)* Sand the edges with sandpaper for a smooth finish.
2. Paint the cactus green with acrylic paint. Add realistic textures or patterns.
3. Paint the plate brown, white, or any color you prefer.
4. Avoid water-activated paint as it may soften the clay.

### **Step 8: Seal & Finish**
1. Once the paint is dry, use **crystal sealing spray** to protect it from moisture and dust.
2. Let the sealant dry completely before using your cactus ring holder.
